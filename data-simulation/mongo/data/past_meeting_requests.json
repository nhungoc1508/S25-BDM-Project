Since then, I've been doing a lot of other stuff, like writing about literature and trying to get more involved in the department. I know I need to work harder, but it's hard to stay motivated when I'm not seeing progress. I'm currently in a history class this semester, and I'm already behind.

Last semester was really challenging for me \u2014 I took a bunch of advanced classes, including a seminar on ancient Greek philosophy and a semester-long research project. I struggled to keep up with the content and felt overwhelmed by the workload. Now I'm in a few more classes, including a history of art class and a new humanities seminar, and I\u2019m feeling even more exhausted. I\u2019m also in a honors-level English class, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m falling behind in that as well. I know I\u2019m doing really good work, but it\u2019s starting to feel overwhelming. I feel like I\u2019m trying to balance everything too heavily, and I\u2019m starting to burn out. I'm worried I\u2019m not doing well enough to handle this course load and I\u2019m having a hard time keeping everything straight."

I\u2019d been writing a lot, but I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere, and I started to feel like I was losing control. Then the pandemic hit, and everything shifted. I started getting depressed, and I started questioning whether what I was doing was even important anymore. Now I\u2019m still in the middle of the project, but I\u2019m feeling really down. I\u2019m also in a new city, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m fitting in or if I\u2019m doing something wrong.

Last semester, I started taking more difficult courses in stakes like the SAT and ACT exams, and I started feeling more anxious and stressed than ever. I\u2019m in a lot of classes, and I\u2019m not sure if I should be taking them or not. My academic performance is still improving, but I\u2019m also feeling like I\u2019m failing in some ways. I\u2019m having trouble focusing, feeling anxious all the time, and losing sleep. I\u2019m also dealing with deep emotional distress related to the pressure I\u2019m feeling to do well academically and the way that high stakes testing can make me feel like I\u2019m not good enough. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m falling behind and that I\u2019ll lose interest in school or even decide to drop out. I\u2019d like some support working on managing my anxiety and emotions, building a supportive study schedule, or finding a safe place to talk about my struggles."

I felt invincible and confident, and I\u2019ve been doing really well academically ever since. However, now I\u2019m in a different semester, and I\u2019m feeling really off. I\u2019m still taking a lot of difficult and challenging courses, but now I\u2019m also taking more electives that are more like my personal interests, like history and philosophy. I\u2019m also going through a really big personal shift, moving from a really stable and stable family to a really unstable and uncertain one. I feel like I\u2019m trying to balance academics and personal growth, but I don\u2019t know if I should be taking these harder courses anymore or if I should be taking more lightly. I\u2019m feeling really down and lost, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ve lost my academic edge or my sense of self because of the shift.

I\u2019ve taken a lot of interesting and challenging courses lately, from international politics to environmental policy to election law. But even though I\u2019m doing well in most of them, I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m falling behind or making mistakes. I\u2019m worried that this major is taking a toll on me emotionally and academically, and I don\u2019t know if I can keep up with what's coming next. I\u2019d really appreciate help understanding what types of courses I should be taking to stay strong in my major and how to balance schoolwork with personal growth."

Last semester was really tough \u2014 I struggled a lot in my history classes, and even though I did well in some of my other courses, I ended up failing a few of them. This semester, I\u2019m still in some of my history classes, but I\u2019m feeling a bit more confident. I\u2019m still trying to stay on top, but it\u2019s getting harder every week. I\u2019m interested in your advice on how to keep up and improve my academic performance in this major. I want to make sure I'm doing everything right."
