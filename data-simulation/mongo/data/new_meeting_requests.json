I felt overwhelmed and unsure if I was doing well enough to pass. Now I'm in a more technical course this semester, and I'm still not sure what to expect. I'm worried that I'll get a lower grade again, and I'm starting to panic. I'm majoring in CS because I love technology and want to work in it, but I don't know if that's what I should be doing.

Last semester was really tough for me \u2014 I felt really confused about what I\u2019m supposed to be doing, and my major was actually not clearly defined. I ended up taking a variety of classes, from literature to history to creative writing, and ended up with a 2.5 GPA. I\u2019m still not sure what I want to do with my degree, and I\u2019m feeling really anxious about graduation and what comes next. I\u2019m in a really good academic community here, but I\u2019m also feeling isolated and unsure how to connect with others who are going through similar experiences."

I\u2019ve taken a few classes so far, including a first-year seminar and a history of science course. I\u2019ve enjoyed the material in both, but I\u2019m feeling a lot more anxious lately than I was before class. Some of the topics are really complex and I\u2019m still learning a lot, and I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m not doing well in the class. I also feel like I don\u2019t quite fit in with the other students in the class, which is making me even more anxious. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m not good enough to be in this major, and I\u2019m having a hard time processing whether or not I should even be in the course."
