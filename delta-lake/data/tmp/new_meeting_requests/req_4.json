Last semester was really rough academically, and I ended up with a B in English based on a mix of lower-level courses and a few major-specific papers. I struggled with writing, and I didn't realize how much I was falling behind until now. I'm taking more English and literature courses this semester, but I still feel like I'm not doing well in them. I'm not sure how to improve my writing skills, especially since I'm not doing research or writing papers like I did last semester. I'm also worried that my grades might drop again if I don't do better. I'm hoping to talk to someone about how to get better at writing in my major and how to stay on track this semester."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-02T13:54:25"}
