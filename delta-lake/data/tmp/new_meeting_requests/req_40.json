I\u2019ve been attending the University of Chicago \u2014 a highly respected arts institution with a broad arts and humanities curriculum \u2014 and I\u2019m really enjoying my art history and studio courses, but I\u2019m still feeling a bit lost. I\u2019m in my first semester, and the major and major requirement are still being finalized. I don\u2019t have a lot of art experience, and I don\u2019t know where to fit in. I\u2019m not a visual artist, but I\u2019m interested in making art and want to explore that direction. I\u2019m also taking some writing and film courses, but I\u2019m not sure how to integrate them into my art education. I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed and unsure if I\u2019m on the right path, and I\u2019m having a hard time finding a good balance between academics and my artistic interests."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-17T17:48:37"}
