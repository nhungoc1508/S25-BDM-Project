This semester has been tough as I'm taking a mix of physics and math courses, and I'm already behind in some of my classes. I'm feeling overwhelmed and questioning if I even like the subject or if I'm doing something wrong. I'm also experiencing a lot of self-doubt, especially around my academic performance. I feel like everyone else is ahead of me and I'm falling behind, even though I've been working hard. I'm worried that I'll fail these courses and lose faith in my ability to succeed in this major. I want help to feel more confident in my work and to find a way to stay engaged in my studies."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-10T09:30:52"}
