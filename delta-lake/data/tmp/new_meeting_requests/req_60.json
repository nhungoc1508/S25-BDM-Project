Last semester was really hard \u2014 I had to take a bunch of economics courses, and I ended up falling behind \u2014 I was behind in my intro courses and had to retake some of them. It was overwhelming, and I ended up feeling confused and frustrated. Now I'm in a few different economics classes, and I'm still not sure what this stuff means. I'm not really interested in business or finance, but I still feel like I'm not making sense of what I'm learning. I'm trying to take some different courses this semester, but I'm not sure if I'm on track. I'm also worried that I'm not passing enough courses to graduate on time, which is making me even more anxious about my major."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-25T10:42:21"}
