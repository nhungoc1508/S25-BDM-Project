I\u2019ve taken a lot of interesting and challenging courses, but lately I\u2019ve been struggling to keep up. Some of my classes have covered topics like addiction, trauma, and mental health, and I\u2019ve found them really interesting but not necessarily applicable to my major. I\u2019m also feeling frustrated because I\u2019ve been doing well in other parts of my life, like my extracurriculars and academic performance overall, but I\u2019m not sure if I should be in this major anymore. I\u2019d really appreciate help understanding what's been happening and how to improve my academic performance without dropping the major entirely."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-02T11:07:10"}
