I\u2019ve taken a few interesting but unrelated courses lately, like \u201cGovernment and Society\u201d and \u201cInternational Relations and Politics\u201d, and I\u2019m finding it hard to keep up with the content and pace. Some of the topics are really complex and I\u2019m not familiar with the theories or methods used in these fields, and I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m falling behind both academically and emotionally. I\u2019m also dealing with some personal issues that are affecting my focus and motivation, and I\u2019m not sure if I should be still in the Political Science major or if I should switch to something else. I\u2019m really enjoying the intellectual content of my classes, but I\u2019m starting to feel overwhelmed and worried that I\u2019m not cut out for this major."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-02T14:03:59"}
