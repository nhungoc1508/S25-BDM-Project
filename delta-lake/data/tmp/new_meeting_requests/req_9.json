I\u2019ve taken a few classes so far, including anthropology and geography. Both of these courses are really interesting, but I\u2019m finding it hard to keep up with the content and the pace. I\u2019m still in college, and I\u2019m still trying to figure out what I want to do with my major. I feel like I\u2019m already falling behind, and I don\u2019t know if I can keep doing this on my own. I\u2019m also dealing with some personal stress from school and family issues, and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m handling it well. I\u2019m interested in talking with someone about how to manage my academic load and my mental health, and I think this is a good opportunity."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-04T17:32:55"}
