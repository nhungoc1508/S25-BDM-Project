Last semester was really tough \u2014 I struggled in most of my art classes, and I ended up with a D-average. It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t do well in some of the more abstract or technical courses, but I just couldn\u2019t keep up. I\u2019m majoring in art because I\u2019ve always loved art, and I\u2019ve been really passionate about it. I\u2019ve always thought I\u2019d major in something like English or history, but now I\u2019m not sure what I should be doing. I\u2019m interested in art history, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good fit or if I should be majoring in something else entirely. I\u2019m also interested in writing and performance, but I\u2019m not sure how to combine those two in a way that makes sense. I\u2019m trying to talk to my professors, but I\u2019m not sure how to articulate what I\u2019m really struggling with or what I\u2019m asking for help on. I\u2019m hoping to schedule an appointment soon so I can get some guidance."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-24T13:33:28"}
