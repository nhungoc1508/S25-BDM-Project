I\u2019ve taken a lot of writing courses and done well in them, but lately my writing has been getting worse. I\u2019m trying to write essays for grad school applications, but I keep getting stuck on the same issues. I also do a lot of academic writing, like reviewing books or summarizing articles, but I don\u2019t see how what I\u2019m doing is relevant to my major. I feel like I\u2019m not even close to understanding what to do with my degree, and I\u2019m having a hard time finding a career path that fits. I\u2019m hoping to talk with someone about how to improve my writing and explore options for graduate school or other writing-related jobs."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-25T17:14:40"}
