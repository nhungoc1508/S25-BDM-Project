I\u2019ve taken a few classes and already feel like I\u2019m in a different world than what I\u2019m used to doing. Some of my classes are really heavy on political theory and history, and I\u2019m not really interested in that. Other than that, I\u2019m not really sure what I\u2019m supposed to be doing here. I\u2019m trying to major in something I\u2019m really passionate about (environmental policy), but I\u2019m not sure if I even fit in here or if I should be switching things up. I\u2019m also feeling really isolated from other students in my major, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m alone in feeling this way."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-08T11:59:20"}
