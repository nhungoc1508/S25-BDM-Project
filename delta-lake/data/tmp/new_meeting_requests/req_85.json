Last semester was really challenging \u2014 I took a few music courses that were really difficult, and I\u2019m still struggling to keep up. Some of the songs I\u2019m playing are really complex and I\u2019m still not sure if I can keep up with the tempo or understanding. I\u2019m also worried about what comes next after graduation. I\u2019m interested in business or arts management, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m even eligible to apply for jobs or internships if I major in music. I\u2019m trying to talk to professors, but I feel overwhelmed and not sure where to start. I need help understanding how to handle this stress and figure out what to do next."}, "timestamp": "2025-05-01T16:52:15"}
