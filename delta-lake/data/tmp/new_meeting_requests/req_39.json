I\u2019ve been doing well academically, with a 3.7 GPA so far. But I\u2019m in a really heavy math-heavy track, and there\u2019re a lot of coursework I\u2019m taking that I don\u2019t really understand or relate to. I\u2019m also in a major that requires a lot of writing and critical thinking, and I find those assignments really difficult. I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed and not sure if I\u2019m doing well enough in my major or if I\u2019m even on track. I\u2019m reaching out because I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m not living up to the expectations of the major I\u2019ve chosen, even though I\u2019m doing well academically."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-17T12:48:46"}
