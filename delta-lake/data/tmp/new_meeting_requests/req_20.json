I\u2019ve taken a lot of political science and international relations courses, and I\u2019ve really enjoyed them but I\u2019m finding it harder than expected to apply what I\u2019ve learned in class to real-world issues. Some of my courses have focused on issues like immigration, climate change, or human rights, and I\u2019m trying to connect what I\u2019ve read to what I\u2019m doing in my internships and student organizations. I feel like I\u2019m falling behind, even though I\u2019ve been working hard. I\u2019d like some help understanding what I\u2019m doing well in my major and how to stay on track, or advice on how to engage more meaningfully with the issues I\u2019m studying."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-09T13:29:57"}
