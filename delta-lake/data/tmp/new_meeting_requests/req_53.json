I\u2019ve taken a lot of interesting courses, but I\u2019m not sure if graduate school is the right fit for what I\u2019ve been studying. My major is Chinese, and I\u2019ve taken classes in Chinese literature, translation, and film, as well as history and philosophy of East Asian civilizations. I\u2019ve also taken courses on globalization, migration, and cultural exchange, which have really engaged me. I\u2019m considering applying to graduate programs in East Asian studies or international affairs, but I\u2019m not sure if I should stay in the Asian studies track or switch to something else. I\u2019m not sure what career path I\u2019m interested in, but I\u2019m interested in something related to language, education, or international relations. I\u2019m worried about transferring if I don\u2019t figure out what I want to do soon."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-23T09:34:45"}
