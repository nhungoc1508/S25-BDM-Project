I\u2019ve taken a lot of history classes lately, both undergrad and through a minor. I\u2019ve really enjoyed them, but I\u2019m finding it harder to understand the concepts and apply them in real contexts. I\u2019m also in a major, which is expected to require a lot of history in some way. I\u2019m worried that if I don\u2019t keep up, I might not make the GPA I\u2019m trying to achieve or get into a good graduate program. I\u2019d like some help understanding what I\u2019m doing well in history and how to keep up, and how to make sure I\u2019m doing well in my major and future studies."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-16T12:13:39"}
