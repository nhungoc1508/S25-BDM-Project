I\u2019ve taken a lot of interesting courses, from climate change to geology to environmental policy. I\u2019ve even interned with a nonprofit and really enjoyed it. But now I\u2019m thinking about graduate school or working in environmental policy or academia. I don\u2019t know which path would be best for me, and I\u2019m feeling a bit overwhelmed. I want advice about whether to pursue graduate school right now or if I should take a year off and explore more options before applying. I also feel like the major I chose is not explicitly focused on policy, and I don\u2019t want to end up doing something that doesn\u2019t align with my long-term goals."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-24T15:30:59"}
