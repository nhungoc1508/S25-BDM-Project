I\u2019ve taken a really challenging course this semester, covering topics like Arabic poetry, Islamic art, and the Quran. I\u2019m really struggling to understand anything, and I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m falling behind and panicking about graduation. I\u2019ve also been dealing with academic pressure and anxiety from other classes, but this one feels different. It\u2019s really immersive and intense, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m not doing enough to succeed. I\u2019m hoping to talk with a counselor about how to stay on track, but I\u2019m not sure how to make an appointment or what to say. I\u2019m excited to work together to get better, but I\u2019m feeling really down right now."}, "timestamp": "2025-05-01T13:05:04"}
