I\u2019ve had a really strong academic experience, with a mix of classes in history, literature, and language. I\u2019ve been really passionate about East Asian cultures and languages, and I\u2019ve done well in my major. Recently, I\u2019ve been thinking about graduate school or industry work as a way to further explore my interests, but I\u2019m not sure what to do next. I\u2019ve had a lot of faculty advisors, and I\u2019ve been working on a thesis, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the right path. I\u2019m also considering transferring to a different major, but I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d like to do after graduation. I\u2019m open to advice on graduate school, industry work, or something else, but I\u2019m not sure where to start."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-22T12:21:12"}
