I\u2019ve taken a bunch of political and social science courses lately and I\u2019m really enjoying them, but I\u2019m also feeling a lot more interested in business and humanities than I was before. I\u2019ve always been interested in politics, but I never thought I\u2019d be in a major that would involve so much of it. I\u2019m majoring because I think it\u2019s a good fit for my interests, but I\u2019m also starting to feel like I\u2019m not doing well in the classes and I don\u2019t know if I can keep up. I want some help understanding what I\u2019m doing well in and what areas need work, and I\u2019m open to any advice or strategies."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-09T14:04:13"}
