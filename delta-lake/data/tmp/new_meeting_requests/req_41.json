I\u2019ve taken a lot of music courses lately, from improvisation to composition to performance. I\u2019ve really enjoyed them, but I\u2019m also feeling the pressure to show progress and get into a music industry or music education program. My peers are doing well, and I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m falling behind. I don\u2019t know if I can keep up, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m missing out on a serious career path if I don\u2019t figure this out. I\u2019m interested in talking about how to stay committed and how to graduate strong in my music major."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-18T10:07:03"}
