I\u2019ve been attending class regularly but still feel like I\u2019m not understanding what we\u2019re doing. Some of the topics we\u2019re covering, like quantum mechanics or astrophysics, are really complex and abstract, and I\u2019m still not sure if I\u2019m making sense. I\u2019m also experiencing academic burnout. I\u2019ve been working hard in class, but I\u2019m also feeling exhausted and overwhelmed by the material. I\u2019m not sure if I should be in this course or if I should be taking something else, but I\u2019m not sure what to do. I\u2019m reaching out because I\u2019m feeling lost and unsure if I\u2019m even doing well in this major."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-22T12:29:18"}
