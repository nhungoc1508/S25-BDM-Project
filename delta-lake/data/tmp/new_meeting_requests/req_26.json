I\u2019ve taken a few courses so far and already feel like I\u2019m in over my head. Some of the readings have been really difficult, and the material is really complex. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m not doing well enough to pass the class, and I\u2019m starting to panic. I\u2019m also really interested in the chemistry of addiction and how drugs work, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m even eligible to take that course or if it\u2019s just too advanced for me. I\u2019m feeling really isolated in my major and worried that everyone else is ahead of me, which is making me even more anxious. I\u2019d love to talk to someone about how to manage my academic and emotional stress, and I\u2019m excited to meet with you about trying something different in my first semester."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-10T12:37:26"}
