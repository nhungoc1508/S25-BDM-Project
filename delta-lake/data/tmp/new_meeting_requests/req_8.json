I\u2019ve taken undergraduate courses in Spanish and French, and I\u2019ve been doing okay in classes like literature and language theory, but I\u2019ve never really been in a high-stakes environment like this one. My major is still being evaluated, and I\u2019m still in the first semester. I feel overwhelmed by the workload and uncertain about how to succeed. I\u2019m struggling with grades, feeling isolated, and questioning if I\u2019m even cut out for this major. I\u2019d like some guidance on how to improve academically and how to navigate this new environment."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-04T16:12:03"}
