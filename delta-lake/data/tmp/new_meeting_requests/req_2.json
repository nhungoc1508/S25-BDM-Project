I\u2019ve been doing okay academically, but lately I\u2019ve been struggling with writing assignments. Some of the essays I\u2019ve written have been okay, but I keep making mistakes. I feel like I\u2019m not doing anything right in my major. I\u2019m not sure if I should be in English or something else, but I\u2019m really passionate about the subject and want to do well. I\u2019m hoping to talk to someone about how to improve and get help."}, "timestamp": "2025-03-29T14:20:10"}
