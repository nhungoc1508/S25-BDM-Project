I\u2019ve taken a few classes and already feel like I\u2019m behind, both academically and emotionally. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll fail this semester and feel like I\u2019m not living up to what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019d like some support dealing with my anxiety and feeling isolated in my major. I\u2019m in a good academic unit, but I\u2019m not sure how to make friends or find a community that can help me. I\u2019m excited to be in college, but I\u2019m still feeling like an outsider."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-29T12:54:48"}
