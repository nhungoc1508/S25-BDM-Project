I\u2019ve been taking a wide variety of courses, from organic chemistry to biochemistry to physics, and I\u2019m trying my best to keep up with the material. However, most of the content is still new to me, and I feel overwhelmed by what I\u2019m learning. My professor\u2019s been helpful, but I\u2019m also feeling frustrated and uncertain about whether I\u2019m doing something wrong or if I\u2019m just not cut out for this major. I\u2019m currently in a chemistry seminar and am also taking a bioinformatics course, which is adding to my load. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m falling behind and will eventually fall behind even more if I keep this up. I\u2019d really appreciate help understanding what I\u2019m doing well in the major, what areas need improvement, and how to stay on track without feeling overwhelmed. I\u2019d also think about exploring other majors or career paths that might be more aligned with my interests and skills."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-16T09:54:55"}
