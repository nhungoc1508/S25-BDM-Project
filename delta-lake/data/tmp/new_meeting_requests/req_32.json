I\u2019ve taken two difficult classes so far and am already feeling like I\u2019m falling behind. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m not measuring up to my major, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m not doing well enough to succeed. I\u2019d like some support dealing with academic pressure and first-year anxiety."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-15T10:05:59"}
