I\u2019ve taken a few classes and already feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of courses and the variety of topics. I\u2019m not particularly interested in traditional academic subjects like history or literature, but I\u2019m not sure what else I should be doing. I also feel isolated from the Asian American community here, and I\u2019m not sure if I belong in the Asian American studies major or if it\u2019s just a bad fit. I\u2019d really appreciate help understanding what I\u2019m doing well in the program, how to engage more deeply with the coursework, and how to find a balance between academic exploration and personal growth."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-22T15:02:42"}
