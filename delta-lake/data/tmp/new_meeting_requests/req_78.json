Last semester was really tough for me \u2014 I felt really confused about what I\u2019m supposed to be doing, and my major was actually not clearly defined. I ended up taking a variety of classes, from literature to history to creative writing, and ended up with a 2.5 GPA. I\u2019m still not sure what I want to do with my degree, and I\u2019m feeling really anxious about graduation and what comes next. I\u2019m in a really good academic community here, but I\u2019m also feeling isolated and unsure how to connect with others who are going through similar experiences."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-30T17:23:32"}
