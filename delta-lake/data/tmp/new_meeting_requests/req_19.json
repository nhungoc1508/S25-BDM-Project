Last semester was really challenging \u2014 I struggled with understanding faith in a post-Christian world, and I\u2019m still grappling with how to reconcile my faith with the new beliefs and values emerging in society. I\u2019ve tried talking to professors, but they don\u2019t seem to know how to address my specific concerns. I\u2019m interested in exploring how I can engage with religious studies in a more nuanced way and learn how to think critically about faith in the modern world. I hope to schedule a meeting to discuss how to build skills and perspectives that will help me navigate this challenging period."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-09T09:58:58"}
