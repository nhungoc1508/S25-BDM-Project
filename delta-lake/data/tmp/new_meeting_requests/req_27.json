This is the final semester of my major, and I\u2019m really feeling the pressure to do well. Last year, I took a lot of history classes and ended up with a 3.5 GPA, but this semester I\u2019m taking more advanced courses and I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t be able to keep up. I\u2019m also involved in a few academic clubs and am trying to balance my studies with extracurriculars and internships. I feel like I\u2019m falling behind, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m even doing the right things. I\u2019m hoping to talk with someone who can help me manage my academic load and work on improving my skills in history."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-11T14:34:23"}
