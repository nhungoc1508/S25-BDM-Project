This is my first semester in college, and I\u2019m really struggling with the course material. Some of the topics are really complex and I\u2019m not sure I understand everything yet. I\u2019m also feeling really anxious about what I\u2019m learning and what I\u2019ll be expected to do in college. I\u2019m in a major that I\u2019m not really passionate about, and I\u2019m not sure if Philosophy is the right fit for me. I feel like I\u2019m not doing well academically and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll fail the course and feel like I\u2019m falling behind."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-21T14:41:39"}
