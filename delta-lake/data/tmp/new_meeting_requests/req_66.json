I\u2019ve taken a few classes so far and am really enjoying the content, but I\u2019m also feeling really stressed out. I\u2019ve been working on a lot of papers, and some of them are really challenging and require a lot of thinking. I\u2019m worried that I won\u2019t be able to handle college-level work, and I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m not measuring up. I also feel a little bit over overwhelmed by all the academic expectations for college students, especially since I\u2019m not really sure what my major even means anymore. I\u2019d love to talk about how to manage my academic load, deal with stress, and figure out if Philosophy is even a good fit for me."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-28T13:09:11"}
