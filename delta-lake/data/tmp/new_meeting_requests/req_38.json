I\u2019ve been doing well academically, but lately I\u2019ve been feeling disillusioned about the state of the country and the political system. I used to be passionate about issues like climate change and inequality, but now I just don\u2019t care anymore. I\u2019m frustrated with the way politics is covered in the media and how politicians are able to manipulate public opinion. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m losing interest in the system I\u2019m trying to change and I don\u2019t know if I should keep pushing or if I should just give up."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-17T11:22:31"}
