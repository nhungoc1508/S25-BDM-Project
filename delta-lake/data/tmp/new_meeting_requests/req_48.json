I\u2019m really enjoying my first-year English professor and some of the themes and topics we\u2019re covering, but I also feel really nervous about the workload and whether I can keep up. I\u2019ve also majored in history, and I\u2019m not sure if that will help me in this major, especially since I\u2019m not really interested in history anymore. I\u2019m still new to college, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m not doing well enough to fit in already."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-22T09:05:17"}
