Last semester was really hard, and I\u2019m still struggling to understand the concepts in my classes. Some of the topics are really complex, and I\u2019m not sure how to apply what I\u2019ve learned to real-world problems. I also have a lot of coursework left, and I\u2019m not sure if I can keep up with the grading schedule. I\u2019m interested in working with a counselor to figure out how to improve my academic performance, but I\u2019m not sure where to start. I\u2019ve been in the computer science program, so I\u2019m familiar with the course content, but I\u2019m still feeling overwhelmed."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-24T14:25:03"}
