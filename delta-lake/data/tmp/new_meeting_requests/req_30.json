I\u2019ve been taking a lot of classes, from English to sociology to education studies. Some of them are interesting, but others are just really heavy and over my head. I\u2019m struggling to keep up with grades, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll fall behind and lose interest. I\u2019m also feeling frustrated by the content and the way it\u2019s being presented. I\u2019d love to talk about what I\u2019m doing wrong and how to improve, but I don\u2019t know how to ask for help or how to make progress in my major."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-14T15:33:25"}
