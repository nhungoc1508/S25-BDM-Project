I\u2019ve taken a lot of interesting courses lately, from social inequality to race and class, and I\u2019ve really enjoyed exploring these topics. But now I\u2019m starting to think about graduate school or working in a social justice organization, and I\u2019m not sure which path would be best. I\u2019ve been in a social justice class last semester, and it was really engaging, but I also had a lot of class participation and I\u2019m not sure if I would be able to do that in a professional setting. I\u2019m also interested in community organizing or social justice work, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s even a legitimate career path right now. I\u2019m feeling really uncertain and overwhelmed, and I\u2019m not sure if I should be taking classes or applying to graduate programs right now. I\u2019d really appreciate help figuring out what I should do next."}, "timestamp": "2025-05-01T16:20:23"}
