Last semester was really challenging \u2014 I took a lot of advanced courses that I didn't really understand, and I ended up with a lot of lower grades. I felt overwhelmed and unsure if I was doing well enough to pass. Now I'm in a more technical course this semester, and I'm still not sure what to expect. I'm worried that I'll get a lower grade again, and I'm starting to panic. I'm majoring in CS because I love technology and want to work in it, but I don't know if that's what I should be doing. I'm feeling disconnected from the academic community in my major and worried that I'm not connecting with the right people. I'm hoping to talk with someone who can help me understand what I'm doing in class, how to approach assignments better, and how to stay on track."}, "timestamp": "2025-03-28T15:27:40"}
