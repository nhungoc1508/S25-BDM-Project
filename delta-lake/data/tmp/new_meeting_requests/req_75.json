Last semester was really tough \u2014 I failed most of my courses, and I\u2019m currently on academic probation. It\u2019s been really hard to focus on anything else, and I\u2019m not sure if I can make it through this semester. I\u2019ve been working hard on coursework, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m even on the right track. I\u2019d love to talk to someone about how to improve my academic performance and feel more confident in my major. I\u2019m open to any advice, from course selection to graduation requirements, but I\u2019m really struggling right now."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-30T11:34:55"}
