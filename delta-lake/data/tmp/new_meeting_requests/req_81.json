I\u2019ve taken two biology classes so far and really enjoyed them, but I\u2019m also in a honors-level English course and a philosophy class. My academic load is heavy, and I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m not keeping up with everything. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m not going to be able to keep up with this major, and I\u2019m starting to feel really anxious and stressed. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m doing well enough to succeed in this major, and I\u2019m worried about whether I\u2019m even qualified to be a Biology major."}, "timestamp": "2025-05-01T12:56:14"}
