Last semester was really tough \u2014 I fell behind in most of my courses, and I\u2019m still not back on track. My grades are down significantly, and I\u2019m starting to feel really discouraged. I\u2019ve been struggling with writing and reading in Chinese, and I\u2019m not sure if I even understand what I\u2019m doing wrong. I\u2019ve been talking to my professors, but they seem frustrated by my performance and are encouraging me to take a break. I\u2019m also dealing with personal issues that have been weighing me down, and I\u2019m not sure how to balance both academics and my personal life. I\u2019m feeling really overwhelmed and not sure if I\u2019m going to make it through this semester without falling further behind."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-04T15:26:09"}
