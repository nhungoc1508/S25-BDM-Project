I\u2019ve taken a mix of English and Spanish classes, and while I\u2019ve enjoyed some of the content, I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m doing a lot of work and not getting anywhere. My grades are still in the high range, but I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m not measuring up to what I\u2019m doing, and I\u2019m starting to wonder if I should major in something like French or Italian instead. I\u2019m also feeling burned out from school, with long days and a lot of work ahead. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m doing okay, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m falling behind or missing something important."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-29T11:49:03"}
