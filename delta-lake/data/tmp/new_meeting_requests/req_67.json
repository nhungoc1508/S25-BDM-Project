Last semester was really tough \u2014 I had a lot of coursework in the major, including a seminar on theater history, a seminar on film and performance, and a theater elective I really enjoyed. But then I took a bunch of upper-level theater courses, and I started to feel like I was overloading and losing ground. I ended up taking a bunch of classes I shouldn\u2019t have been taking, and I started to feel like I was falling behind both academically and artistically. Now I\u2019m feeling really discouraged and unsure if I can keep up. I\u2019m in a really good theater major, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing anything particularly well in it. I\u2019m not doing well in any of my theater classes, and I\u2019m struggling to keep up with the reading and assignments. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m going to fall behind and lose confidence in my ability to succeed in the major."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-28T14:09:48"}
