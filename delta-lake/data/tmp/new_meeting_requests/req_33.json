This is my first semester in college, and I\u2019ve already taken a few major-specific courses and some general environmental studies classes. However, I\u2019m feeling a lot more stressed than I thought I would be, and I\u2019m questioning if I even belong in this major or if I should be switching to something else. I also feel really burned out from school and feeling like I\u2019m doing something important, but I don\u2019t know if that's what I\u2019m doing. I'm worried I'm not doing well enough to be in this major, and I'm not sure how to get help."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-15T12:11:03"}
