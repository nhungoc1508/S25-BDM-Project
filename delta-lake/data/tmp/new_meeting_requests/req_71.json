I\u2019ve taken a lot of math courses, both core and elective, and I\u2019ve really enjoyed them all. I\u2019ve even been able to earn high grades, but now I feel like I\u2019m falling behind and not really understanding what I\u2019m doing wrong. I\u2019m still in a major that requires a lot of math, and I\u2019m not sure if I should be trying to major in math or if I should be switching to something else. I\u2019m also involved in a few math-focused clubs and trying to connect with the community, but I feel overwhelmed by all the material and feel like I\u2019m not doing enough to succeed."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-29T12:10:59"}
