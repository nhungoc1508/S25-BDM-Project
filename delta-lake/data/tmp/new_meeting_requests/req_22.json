I\u2019ve taken two difficult classes so far and feel like I\u2019m falling behind. I\u2019m still in the learning process, but I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll fail my major and feel like I\u2019m not cut out for college. I\u2019m also dealing with anxiety around school and personal goals. I\u2019d like some support dealing with these emotions and figuring out how to thrive in this major."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-09T14:20:10"}
