I\u2019ve taken a lot of difficult and abstract courses lately, and I\u2019m feeling frustrated. Some of my grades are still low, and I\u2019m not sure if I should keep going or if I\u2019ve reached a plateau. I\u2019ve also been involved in some Philosophy-related clubs and events, and I\u2019m trying to connect with the community, but I feel like I\u2019m still not fully engaged. I\u2019m interested in exploring my career options after undergraduate study, but I don\u2019t know where to start or what to do. I want to talk to someone who can help me feel more confident, make progress, and figure out what's possible."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-18T15:04:59"}
