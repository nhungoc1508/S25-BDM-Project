Last semester was really tough \u2014 I struggled a lot in my sociology and anthropology courses, and I\u2019m not sure if I did well enough to pass them. I\u2019m also feeling overwhelmed by the rest of my major and some of my other coursework, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m falling behind and will fail the major if I don\u2019t do better. I\u2019m currently in a mix of anthropology and history courses, and I\u2019m really interested in the intersection of humanity and culture, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m doing something meaningful with my major. I feel like I\u2019m falling behind and afraid I\u2019ll never catch up, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll drop out or lose interest if things keep getting this bad."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-24T12:51:23"}
