I\u2019ve taken a few classes so far and really enjoyed some of the readings, but lately I\u2019m feeling a lot more anxious than I used to. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m not doing well enough to pass the course, and I\u2019m also starting to wonder if I should be majoring in something else entirely. I\u2019ve always been interested in the humanities, but I don\u2019t know if I should be trying to pursue a serious academic field like philosophy at this early stage. I\u2019d love to talk to someone about how to manage my workload and feel more confident in what I\u2019m doing, and I think this is a good opportunity to get some support."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-16T13:42:01"}
