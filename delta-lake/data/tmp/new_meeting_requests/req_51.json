I\u2019ve been doing well academically, with a 3.7 GPA and a mix of biology and math courses. However, I\u2019m feeling a bit lost lately. Some of my biology classes have covered different topics, and I\u2019m not sure how to connect what I\u2019m learning to real-world applications or how I\u2019ll apply it. I\u2019m also feeling pressure to do well in finals, which are coming up soon. I\u2019m not sure if I should be worried about grades or if I\u2019m just getting tired of the coursework. I\u2019d like some guidance on how to stay on track and feel more confident in my biology studies."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-22T13:52:19"}
