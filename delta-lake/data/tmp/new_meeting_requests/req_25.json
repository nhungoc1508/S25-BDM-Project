I\u2019ve taken a few electives so far and really enjoyed some of the history and sociology courses, but I\u2019m still not sure what I want to do with my major. I\u2019ve been thinking about working in politics or nonprofits, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the right path or if I need to explore other options first. I\u2019m also feeling overwhelmed by all the information I\u2019ve already taken and the demands of college, especially since I\u2019m not in a major that requires a lot of writing or critical thinking. I\u2019m not sure if I should be feeling this way, but it\u2019s definitely affecting my academic and personal engagement."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-10T10:20:22"}
