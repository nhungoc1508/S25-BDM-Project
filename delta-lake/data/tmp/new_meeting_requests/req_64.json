Last semester was really tough \u2014 I had to transition from a completely different major (psychology) to Religion, and it was a big adjustment. I felt really low at times, especially during the pandemic when everything felt overwhelming. Now I\u2019m trying to figure out what\u2019s next, and I\u2019m still feeling a bit anxious about what I\u2019ll do after graduation. I\u2019m open to talking about depression, anxiety, graduation stress, or anything else related to post-graduation adjustment. I\u2019ve talked to some professors and peers, but I\u2019m still feeling alone in how I feel."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-28T11:53:24"}
