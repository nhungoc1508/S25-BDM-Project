I'm really enjoying my major and the courses I'm taking, but I'm not sure if I want to pursue a traditional environmental science career or something more specialized like environmental policy or outreach. I'm still in the early stages of my major, and I'm worried about whether I'll be ready for a more advanced career in environmental science or if I should focus more on academic research or public engagement. I'm also concerned about the job market for students with environmental majors right now, especially with the recent political climate around climate change and environmental issues."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-07T15:32:39"}
