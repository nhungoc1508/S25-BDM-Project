Last semester was really tough \u2014 I struggled with depression and anxiety, and I\u2019m still dealing with those issues now. I felt like everything was falling apart, and I felt like I was lost without a clear sense of purpose. I ended up taking a lot of classes that weren\u2019t directly related to my major, and I ended up overloading with coursework and feeling overwhelmed. I started talking to friends and faculty about how I was feeling, but I didn\u2019t realize how deep the depression was until I started feeling like I was losing control. I\u2019m still trying to figure out what comes next, and I feel like I\u2019m not alone in this. I want to talk to someone about how to get better and work on rebuilding my sense of self and direction."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-09T15:23:53"}
