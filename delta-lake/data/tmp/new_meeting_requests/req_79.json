I\u2019ve taken a few classes so far, including a first-year seminar and a history of science course. I\u2019ve enjoyed the material in both, but I\u2019m feeling a lot more anxious lately than I was before class. Some of the topics are really complex and I\u2019m still learning a lot, and I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m not doing well in the class. I also feel like I don\u2019t quite fit in with the other students in the class, which is making me even more anxious. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m not good enough to be in this major, and I\u2019m having a hard time processing whether or not I should even be in the course."}, "timestamp": "2025-05-01T10:20:19"}
