I\u2019ve taken a lot of interesting courses, from history to education policy to teaching methods. But even though I\u2019ve done well academically, I\u2019ve started to feel like I\u2019m not quite fitting in or understanding what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not sure if I should be in the education major or if I should switch to something else, but I\u2019m worried I\u2019m falling behind and not doing well enough to graduate on time. I\u2019m also struggling with personal essays and feeling like I don\u2019t have a strong voice as a student. I\u2019d love to talk with someone about how to stay on track and feel more confident in my education."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-03T15:30:34"}
