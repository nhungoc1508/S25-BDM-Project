I\u2019ve been in the arts program at this university, and so far I\u2019ve taken a lot of really interesting courses, including a studio art class on environmental art and another one on the history of art and race. But I\u2019m also in a really large arts program with a lot of students, and I\u2019m feeling like everyone else in my class is already ahead of me academically, and I don\u2019t know if I can keep up. I also really love art, but I feel like I don\u2019t fit into the social aspects of the major, like how to connect with other artists or find a community. I\u2019m not sure if this is just a first-year feeling or if I\u2019m going to be really isolated in this major if I keep going."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-07T14:11:46"}
