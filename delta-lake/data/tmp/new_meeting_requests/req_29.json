I've been doing well in some of my upper-level music courses, like harmony and counterpoint, but I'm starting to feel like I'm falling behind in harder and more abstract ones. Last semester, I took two harder music theory courses and another one on jazz improvisation. I got a C- in each one, and I'm not sure if I did enough to pass. Now I'm in a music elective that's more like the ones I'm struggling in, and I'm worried I'll get a D or lower. I feel frustrated and discouraged, and I don't know if I'm even doing enough to keep up. I'm hoping to talk to someone about how to improve my performance in music courses, especially since I'm in a major."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-14T11:20:17"}
