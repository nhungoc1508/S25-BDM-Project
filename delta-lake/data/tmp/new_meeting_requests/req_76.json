I\u2019ve taken two difficult classes so far and feel like I\u2019m falling behind. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll fail these majors and feel like I\u2019m not cut out for college. I\u2019m also dealing with anxiety around school and personal goals. I\u2019d like some support dealing with my first semester and how to manage academically."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-30T13:03:36"}
