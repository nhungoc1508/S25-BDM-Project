This is the second semester of my honors English course, and I\u2019m really struggling to understand the complex ideas being covered. Some of the readings are really challenging and require deep analysis, and I\u2019m finding it hard to separate between what I\u2019ve already understood and what I need to understand now. I\u2019m also feeling overwhelmed by the course load overall, with two other majors and a minor and a bunch of required writing courses. I\u2019m not doing well in any of my other courses, and this is starting to affect my grades. I\u2019m hoping to talk to someone about how to stay on track in this semester and improve my academic performance."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-18T16:25:04"}
