I\u2019ve been taking a lot of technical courses lately, and I\u2019m starting to feel overwhelmed. In my first two semesters, I took two CS classes and two math classes, and I ended up with a B in each one. But now I\u2019m taking three more advanced CS courses, and I\u2019m starting to get a little bit behind. My grades are still okay, but I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m falling behind, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m not going to be able to keep up this semester. I\u2019m also taking a couple of electives, including a course on machine learning and another on computer security. I\u2019m not sure if these courses are going to be harder than the ones I\u2019ve already been doing, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m going to fall behind again."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-07T17:22:14"}
