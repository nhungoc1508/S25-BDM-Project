I\u2019ve enjoyed the course very much, but I\u2019m also feeling a bit disillusioned about what the future holds for the arts. I\u2019ve always loved art, but I don\u2019t know if I want to pursue a career in it. I\u2019m not sure what I should be studying or doing, and I feel like I\u2019m losing touch with what I\u2019m passionate about. I\u2019m also worried about the economic and social impact of the arts, and I\u2019m worried that I might be leaving something important behind if I don\u2019t figure out what to do soon."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-08T12:18:40"}
