I\u2019ve taken a lot of difficult and abstract courses lately, and I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m falling behind. Some of the classes even overlap with my major, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m not doing enough to stay in the program. I\u2019re also involved in a few student organizations, and I\u2019m trying to balance them all while studying. I feel frustrated and uncertain about whether I\u2019m even capable of doing what I\u2019m doing in my major, and I\u2019m not sure how to get help. I\u2019m hoping to meet with a counselor or mentor who can help me plan out my coursework more effectively, or to discuss whether my approach is working or if I need to make any major changes."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-23T09:39:44"}
