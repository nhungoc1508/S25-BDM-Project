I\u2019ve been doing really well in my classes, with a 3.8 GPA. But lately, I\u2019ve been feeling more anxious about my grades and worried that I won\u2019t be able to keep up. I\u2019ve also been struggling with some of the more historical or theoretical aspects of my courses, and I\u2019m finding it harder to connect with the material in a meaningful way. I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed by everything I\u2019ve already done, and not sure if I can keep going. I\u2019m hoping to talk to someone about how to stay focused and improve my academic performance, but I\u2019m not sure how to ask for help or what to say. I\u2019m also interested in exploring some creative writing or digital media options as a way to shift my focus away from history and into something more contemporary or experimental."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-11T15:04:18"}
