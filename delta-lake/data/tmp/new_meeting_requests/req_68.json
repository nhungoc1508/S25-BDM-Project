Last semester I took a course in art history that I found challenging and uninteresting. I\u2019ve been struggling with the material, and I\u2019m not sure if I should have even tried it. After the first few weeks, I started to feel really down. I didn\u2019t want to do the work anymore, and I started avoiding art-related activities. Now I\u2019m in a major course, and I\u2019m really invested in it, but I\u2019m also really scared of failing. I feel like everyone else in my class is doing better than me, and I\u2019m starting to feel like a failure. I don\u2019t know if I should be still in the course, or if I should drop out. I\u2019m reaching out because I\u2019m worried about how to cope with this emotional distress, and I\u2019m not sure who to talk to."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-28T14:28:25"}
