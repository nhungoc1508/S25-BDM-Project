I\u2019ve really enjoyed my major and have been doing well academically. However, I\u2019m still not sure if graduate school is the right path for me or if I should consider working in the Middle East after graduation. I\u2019m interested in exploring my options and talking with someone about what opportunities are available. I\u2019m interested in graduate school, but I\u2019m also interested in working in the Middle East after graduation, and I\u2019m not sure if that would be a good fit. I\u2019m also interested in exploring other career paths that involve working with the Middle East or studying the region, but I\u2019m not sure where to start."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-30T16:48:00"}
