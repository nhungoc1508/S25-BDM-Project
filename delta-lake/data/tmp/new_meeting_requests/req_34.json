Last semester was really tough \u2014 I struggled in my history of Europe course and got a D- on the final exam. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m doing something wrong this year, or if I\u2019m just not cut out for the major. I\u2019m trying to stay in the department, but it\u2019s not helping. I\u2019m interested in internships and career paths related to history, but I\u2019m not sure how to get involved or what courses I should be taking to get ready. I\u2019m also interested in exploring other majors, but I don\u2019t know if history is the right fit for me. I want to talk to someone about how to stay in my major and improve my academic performance."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-16T09:52:52"}
