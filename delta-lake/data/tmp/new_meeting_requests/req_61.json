I\u2019m majoring in English and have taken a few classes so far, but I\u2019m already feeling a lot of pressure to perform well. Some of the courses are really challenging and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to tackle them at this level. I\u2019m also dealing with some personal issues that are making me anxious, and I\u2019m not sure how to balance all this stress with my personal life. I\u2019m feeling really isolated and unsure of who I am as a student or a person right now."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-25T16:10:05"}
