Last semester was really tough for me, and I started to feel a lot of anxiety and uncertainty about where I\u2019m even going. I took a lot of history classes, and I ended up taking at least 10 different ones, including European and American history, World War II, and early modern Europe. I ended up taking about 3/4 of my load in one semester, and I ended up with a C+ average. I\u2019m still struggling to balance schoolwork and personal life, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m not measuring up to what I\u2019m doing in class or how I\u2019m showing up. I\u2019m really feeling like I\u2019m not in control of what I\u2019m doing or where I\u2019m heading, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m not going to graduate on time because of all the stress I\u2019m putting in."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-18T13:22:31"}
