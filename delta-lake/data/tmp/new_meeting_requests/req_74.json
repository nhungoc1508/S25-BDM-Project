Last semester was really tough for me \u2014 I took a bunch of Romance courses, including \u201cRomantic Poetry and Prose\u201d, \u201cThe Romantic Revolution\u201d, and \u201cRomanticism and Modernity\u201d, and I ended up falling behind and feeling overwhelmed. This semester, I\u2019m taking \u201cRomanticism and Literary Theory\u201d and \u201cRomanticism and Film\u201d, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll be even more behind than last time. I\u2019m still really enjoying Romance, but I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m not cut out for these kinds of courses yet, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll fall behind again if I don\u2019t work hard. I want to talk to someone about how to stay on track in these courses and whether I\u2019m doing enough to succeed this semester."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-30T11:20:05"}
