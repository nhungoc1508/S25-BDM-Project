I\u2019ve taken a bunch of political science and international relations courses, but I\u2019m finding it harder than ever to keep up with the content and the pace. Some of the classes even cover topics I don\u2019t really care about, like immigration or human rights. I\u2019m feeling frustrated and worried that I\u2019m not doing well in this major, and I\u2019m having a hard time expressing how much it\u2019s been affecting me. I\u2019d love to talk with someone about how to stay engaged in this coursework and improve my academic performance, but I don\u2019t know where to find an honest counselor like you."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-24T13:42:30"}
