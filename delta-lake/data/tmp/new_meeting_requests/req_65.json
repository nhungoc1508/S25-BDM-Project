Last semester was really tough \u2014 I fell behind in most of my courses, and I had to take a bunch of electives just to stay in the math track. Now I\u2019m trying to catch up, but everything is getting harder. I\u2019m still struggling with math concepts, and I\u2019m getting frustrated. I\u2019m also dealing with some personal issues that are affecting my academic performance, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m falling apart or if I\u2019m just not cut out for math. I\u2019m open to talking about how to improve academically, but I\u2019m not sure where to start. I want someone who can help me navigate this challenging major and work out a plan for improvement."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-28T12:03:44"}
