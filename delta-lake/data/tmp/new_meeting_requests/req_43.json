Last semester was really hard \u2014 I struggled with most of my chemistry courses, and I\u2019m still not fully recovered. My professor even gave me a low grade on one of my papers because I\u2019d made mistakes in a lab. Now I\u2019m trying to catch up, but it\u2019s still really overwhelming. I\u2019m feeling frustrated and lost, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll fall behind again this semester. I\u2019m interested in talking to someone about how to approach chemistry better this time around, and I\u2019m hoping you can help me get on track."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-18T13:00:50"}
