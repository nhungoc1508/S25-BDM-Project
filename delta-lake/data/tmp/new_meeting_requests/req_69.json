I\u2019ve taken a few history courses and really enjoyed them, but I\u2019m also in a major with a lot of math and science courses, and I\u2019m still feeling like I don\u2019t quite fit in with the academic culture here. I\u2019m not sure if I should be in this major, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m not measuring up academically. I\u2019m also really interested in writing and history, but I don\u2019t know how to connect what I\u2019m learning to something meaningful or how to do research. I\u2019m attending a private university with a very strong academic culture, and I\u2019m feeling like everyone else is already ahead of me, but I don\u2019t know if I belong here."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-29T10:53:44"}
