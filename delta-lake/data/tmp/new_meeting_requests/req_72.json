I\u2019m still in my first semester, and already feeling the pressure to do well in all my classes. Some of my classes are really challenging, with topics like climate change, earthquakes, and geology. I\u2019m also majoring in Environmental Studies, which is a broad field with a lot of overlap. It\u2019s hard not to get caught up in everything I\u2019m reading and hearing about, and I\u2019m starting to feel overwhelmed. I\u2019m not sure if I should be taking all these classes, and I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m not measuring up to what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m also worried about majoring in something I don\u2019t really care about, and I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m making the right choice."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-29T12:52:57"}
