Last semester was really challenging for me academically. I took a number of difficult and advanced economics courses, and I ended up with a B-minus average in my major. It was really hard to keep up, and I started to feel overwhelmed. Now, this semester, I'm taking more economics-related courses and I'm still struggling. I'm also dealing with some personal stress and anxiety, and I'm not sure if my academic performance is going to keep up with my emotional and mental health. I'm taking this course because it's part of my major, but I feel like I'm not doing well enough to keep up. I'm worried that I'll fall behind again and get a bad grade, which will make me feel even more anxious and discouraged."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-08T16:15:34"}
