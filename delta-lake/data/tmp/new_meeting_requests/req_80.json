I\u2019ve taken a rigorous introductory course this semester and already feel like I\u2019m behind. Some of the readings are really challenging, and the lectures are long and dense. I\u2019m struggling to understand concepts even partially, and I\u2019m starting to feel overwhelmed. I\u2019m also feeling a bit burned out from school already, and I\u2019m not sure if I can keep up this level of academic engagement. I\u2019m not in any particularly tight academic bind yet, but I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m going to fall behind and feel really bad if I don't keep up."}, "timestamp": "2025-05-01T12:25:13"}
