I\u2019ve taken a few music courses and really enjoyed them, but I\u2019m also in a honors-level music major and a lot of what I\u2019m doing is studying music theory, history, and performance. I\u2019ve been in classes with very talented students, and I feel like I\u2019m taking on a lot of pressure to perform well. I\u2019m also in a research-intensive major, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m not doing enough research to prepare for music school. I\u2019m feeling really stressed and anxious about everything I\u2019m doing, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing okay."}, "timestamp": "2025-03-28T11:08:00"}
