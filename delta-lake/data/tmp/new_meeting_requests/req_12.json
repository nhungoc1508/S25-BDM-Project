I\u2019ve taken a lot of interesting courses, but I\u2019m not really sure what I\u2019m good at yet. My psychology professor even acknowledged that I\u2019m not really interested in the major, but I keep pushing myself. I\u2019m also taking some neuroscience and language courses, but I\u2019m not sure if those are even related to psychology. I feel like I\u2019m falling behind, and I don\u2019t know if I can keep doing this. I\u2019m doing okay academically, but I\u2019m starting to feel overwhelmed and worried about whether I\u2019m even qualified to major in psychology. I\u2019d love to talk to someone about how to improve my academic performance without sacrificing my passion or understanding of the field."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-07T17:10:24"}
