I\u2019ve taken a lot of history courses over the past few years, and I\u2019ve ended up majoring in history. This semester, I\u2019m taking a history of Europe course that I really enjoy, but I\u2019m feeling a bit overwhelmed by the material. My professor has been really helpful, but sometimes it feels like there\u2019s a lot of information to digest, and I just don\u2019t know where to start. I\u2019m also taking a history of the Americas course next semester, and I\u2019m not sure if I should be taking both of those or just focus on one. I\u2019m feeling frustrated and worried that I\u2019m falling behind, and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m doing anything wrong or if I should be worried about graduating on time."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-08T10:04:54"}
