I\u2019ve been doing well academically, but I\u2019m finding it harder than usual to write effectively, especially in my writing-intensive courses. Last semester, I took a writing seminar and a research paper, and both were really difficult. I spent hours drafting papers, but then I would get stuck on the same structure or analysis, and I would end up with a mess of a draft. This semester, I\u2019m taking a writing seminar and a research paper again, and I\u2019m already behind on my work. I know I need to improve, but I find writing and presentation difficult even when I know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not sure how to get better, so I\u2019m reaching out to talk about strategies. I want to work with a tutor or mentor to work on a writing plan, practice writing in different contexts, and learn how to present my work effectively."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-08T11:55:47"}
