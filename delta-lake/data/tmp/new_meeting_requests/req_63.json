I've been doing okay academically, but lately I've been struggling with writing assignments. Most of the material I'm working on is literary criticism, and I find it hard to connect with the text on a deep level. I'm also feeling overwhelmed by the course load and feel like I'm not keeping up. I'm not sure if I'm doing anything wrong or if I need help, and I'm worried that I'm falling behind because of my major. I'm hoping to talk to someone who can help me improve my writing and feel more confident in my work."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-27T14:10:05"}
