I\u2019ve taken a lot of interesting courses, but not sure if graduate school is the right fit right now. I\u2019ve been considering industry work or a nonprofit, but I\u2019m not sure if I want to go back to a traditional academic setting. Also, I\u2019m really passionate about Romance languages and literature, but I don\u2019t know if I can make a living doing that. I\u2019m open to exploring options, but I\u2019m not sure where to start. Can you help me think through my career path and potential transfer options? I want to make sure I make the right decision."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-18T12:42:20"}
