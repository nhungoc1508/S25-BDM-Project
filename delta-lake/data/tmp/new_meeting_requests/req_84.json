This semester has been especially tough \u2014 I\u2019m taking a lot of different courses, including some really challenging ones like addiction psychology and trauma intervention, and I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m falling behind. I\u2019ve been working hard, but I\u2019m also starting to question if I even like psychology or if I should be majoring in something else. I\u2019m struggling to focus and feel like I\u2019m losing interest, even though I\u2019ve really enjoyed some of the content I\u2019m learning. I feel like I\u2019m not doing well enough in class to pass, but I also feel like I\u2019m not really engaged with the material enough to pass on my own. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m falling behind and that I\u2019m not going to graduate on time, which would be devastating for my mental health and my future."}, "timestamp": "2025-05-01T16:46:11"}
