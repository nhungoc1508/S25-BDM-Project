I\u2019ve taken a mix of humanities and social science courses, but I\u2019m still trying to figure out what I\u2019m supposed to do here. My major is interesting, but I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m supposed to be doing. I\u2019ve taken some classes that are really heavy on social issues, but I don\u2019t really understand how to apply that to my major. I also feel like I don\u2019t fit in with the other students here, even though I\u2019m from a different socioeconomic background. I\u2019m worried I\u2019m not doing well enough to be a Sociology major, and I\u2019m not sure how to get help."}, "timestamp": "2025-04-14T16:11:27"}
